# Predicting Box Office Revenue Using Weighted Sentiment Analysis of Early Reviews

**Overview:**

This project explores the relationship between early film reviews and box office revenue.  We develop a predictive model that aggregates sentiment scores from reviews, weighting them based on reviewer credibility, to forecast a movie's financial performance. This analysis aims to provide a more accurate prediction tool for studio investment decisions, potentially mitigating financial risk associated with film production.  The analysis involves data cleaning, sentiment analysis, model training, and performance evaluation.

**Technologies Used:**

* Python 3
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* NLTK (or equivalent sentiment analysis library)
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn


**How to Run:**

1. **Clone the repository:**  `git clone <repository_url>`
2. **Install dependencies:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Run the main script:** `python main.py`

**Example Output:**

The script will print key analysis results to the console, including details on model performance metrics (e.g., R-squared, RMSE).  Additionally, the script generates several visualization files (e.g., `sales_trend.png`, potentially others depending on the analysis performed) illustrating relationships between sentiment scores, review credibility, and box office revenue.  These plots are saved in the project's directory.  The specific output will vary based on the dataset used and the model trained.
